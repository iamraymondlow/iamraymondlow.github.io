<div>
    <p>I am currently a fourth-year PhD candidate at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the Engineering Systems and Design Pillar. My primary research focuses on applying various machine learning techniques such as active learning, deep generative models, and deep reinforcement learning to tackle a wide range of data issues frequently encountered in urban freight studies. Some of these issues include data sparsity, data imbalance, incomplete data, and datasets with high annotation costs. As a researcher in the Sustainable Urban Mobility Research Laboratory, I also regularly work with heterogeneous datasets such as GPS traces, digital travel surveys, and geographic points of interest data to study urban freight activity in an urban setting.</p>
    <p>I am currently looking for full-time job opportunities for the following roles: Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Machine Learning Research Scientist.</p>
