I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), under the Engineering Systems and Design Pillar. My primary research focuses on applying active learning, data engineering, data fusion, deep reinforcement learning, and deep generative models to tackle various data issues frequently encountered in urban freight transportation. These issues include data sparsity, data imbalance, incomplete data, and data with high labelling costs. I am also interested in applying various machine learning techniques and IoT technologies to monitor occupant behaviour in the built environment, such as office spaces. Through this summer internship programme, I intend to take my research to the next level by applying the highly transferable skills and knowledge I have gained during my time in SUTD to contribute to the organisation's real-world projects.

As a researcher in the Sustainable Urban Mobility Research Laboratory, much of my work revolves around using various heterogeneous datasets such as GPS traces, digital travel surveys, and geographic point of interest information to study freight travel activity in an urban setting.
