<div>
    <p>I am a Data Scientist/Algorithm Engineer at the Maps Team in Shopee with a PhD doctorate from the Singapore University of Technology and Design.</p>

    <p>I have extensive experience developing and deploying highly performant and scalable autocomplete and ranking systems to support map search services in Southeast Asia's largest E-commerce company. I also possess first-hand experience conducting A/B tests and have developed highly robust data engineering pipelines capable of processing millions of user tracker data collected on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>Prior to entering the industry, my primary research focus was on applying various machine learning techniques, such as active learning, deep generative imputation models, and deep reinforcement learning to tackle a wide range of data issues frequently encountered in urban freight studies. Some of these issues include data sparsity, data imbalance, incomplete data, and datasets with high annotation costs. As an ex-researcher in the Sustainable Urban Mobility Research Laboratory, I also regularly worked with heterogeneous datasets such as GPS traces, digital travel surveys, and geographic points of interest data to study urban freight activity in an urban setting.</p>

    <p>I am currently looking for full-time job opportunities for the following roles: Data Scientist, Algorithm Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and Research Scientist. Please feel free to connect with me if you have any relevant opportunities!</p>
