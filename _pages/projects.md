My primary research focuses on applying active learning, data engineering, data fusion, deep reinforcement learning, 
and deep generative models to tackle various data issues commonly encountered in urban freight transportation. These 
issues include data sparsity, data imbalance, incomplete data, and data with high labelling costs. I also have 
experience developing smart energy management systems using IoT technologies and web applications.
