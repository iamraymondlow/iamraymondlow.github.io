# Current Projects

## Deep Reinforcement Active Learning for Commercial Vehicle Travel Survey
Period: Jul 20 – Present
Developing a reinforcement learning algorithm to perform active learning on a commercial vehicle travel survey dataset.

## An End-to-End Point of Interest (POI) Conflation Study
Period: Sep 19 – Present
Used Python, Natural Language Processing, and ensemble models to identify POI matches between different geospatial data sources and performed POI conflation to obtain a comprehensive and unified dataset.

## Project Plug-Mate
Period: Sep 18 – Present
Used Python to develop a smart energy management system for automating users’ devices based on presence information.
Developed the system’s web interface using the Django web framework with a backend PostgreSQL database.
Developed an indoor localisation system by deploying Raspberry Pi to scan for users’ smartphone devices and feeding the sensing data into an ensemble model to infer the users’ room-level locations.
Developed a real-time plug load identification module that performs device-type classification based on energy signatures.
