    <h3>An End-to-End Point of Interest (POI) Conflation Study</h3>
    <p><strong>Period</strong>: September 2019 to Present (Ongoing)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Used Python, Natural Language Processing, and Ensemble models to identify POI matches between different geospatial data sources and performed POI conflation to obtain a comprehensive and unified dataset.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h3>Project Plug-Mate</h3>
    <p><strong>Period</strong>: September 2018 to Present (Ongoing)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Used Python to develop a smart energy management system for automating users’ devices based on presence information.</li>
      <li>Developed the system’s web interface using the Django web framework with a backend PostgreSQL database.</li>
      <li>Developed an indoor localisation system by deploying Raspberry Pi to scan for users’ smartphone devices and feeding the sensing data into an ensemble model to infer the users’ room-level locations.</li>
      <li>Developed a real-time plug load identification module that performs device-type classification based on energy signatures.</li>
    </ul>
