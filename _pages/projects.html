  <h2>Current Projects</h2>

  <div>
    <h3>Heavy Vehicle Stop Activity Classification using POI and GPS Traces</h3>
    <p><strong>Period</strong>: January 2021 to Present (Ongoing)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developing a multi-label classification model for inferring heavy vehicle stop activities based on GPS traces and POI data.</li>
      <li>Developing an on-the-fly POI conflation tool to unify multiple geospatial data sources.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Deep Reinforcement Active Learning for Heterogeneous Datasets</h3>
    <p><strong>Period</strong>: July 2020 to May 2021</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed a metaheuristic active learning strategy selection model using Deep Reinforcement Learning to tackle inconsistent performance between different active learning algorithms when encountering heterogeneous datasets.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Project Plug-Mate</h3>
    <p><strong>Period</strong>: September 2018 to January 2021</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Used Python to develop a smart energy management system for automating users’ devices based on presence information.</li>
      <li>Developed the system’s web interface using the Django web framework with a backend PostgreSQL database.</li>
      <li>Developed an indoor localisation system by deploying custom-built IoT sensors to scan for users’ smartphone devices and feeding the sensing data into an ensemble model to infer the users’ zone-level locations.</li>
      <li>Developed a real-time plug load identification module that performs device-type classification based on energy signatures.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>An End-to-End Point of Interest (POI) Conflation Study</h3>
    <p><strong>Period</strong>: September 2019 to November 2020</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Used various Natural Language Processing techniques and ensemble models to identify POI matches between different geospatial data sources and performed data conflation to obtain a unified POI dataset.</li>
    </ul>
